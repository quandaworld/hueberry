## Backstory

While working as a cashier for Target, I noticed that beyond their iconic red, they used a variety of accent colors that appeared throughout the store. I wondered how their designers ensure that their content consistently follows brand guidelines—not just which colors to use, but in what proportions? This inspired me to create Hueberry, a color analytics platform that automatically extracts, quantifies, and organizes color data from visual assets, helping teams maintain precise brand consistency without the guesswork.
